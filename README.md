# 🎓 School Management System (SQL Server)

This project demonstrates how to design and implement a **School Management System** using **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)** and **SQL Server**.  
It covers the full process from database design → schema creation → CRUD operations.

## 📌 Features
- Database schema designed with **ERD principles**.
- Relationships include **1-M**, **M-1**, and **M-M** (via a bridge table).
- Tables:
  - `Student`
  - `Instructor`
  - `Course`
  - `Enrollment` (bridge between Student & Course)
- SQL queries for:
  - **Create** (insert dummy data)
  - **Read** (select queries & joins)
  - **Update** (modify existing records)
  - **Delete** (remove specific records)
